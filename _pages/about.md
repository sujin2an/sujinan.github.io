Hi ðŸ˜„. I'm a member of [Natural-Intelligence Lab (NILAB)](https://natural-intelligence-lab.github.io/) as post-master researcher supervised by hansem sohn. 

My research passion lies in exploring the fascinating concept of higher cognition. To unravel the complexities of this intriguing topic, I delve into studies involving humans, non-human primates (NHPs), and artificial intelligence. 

By bridging these diverse fields, I aim to better understand the nature of intelligence and the mechanisms that underlie advanced cognitive processes.

For more information, see the [project](/al-folio/projects/) I'm currently working on.
